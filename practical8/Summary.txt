We can use the knowledge in this practical to compair 2 sequences. And the difference can be reflected quantitatively, such as the score calculated by referring to Blosum 62. It is quite interesting and meaningful.
However, I am still wondering the situation where the lengths of two sequences are different.
Additionally, how can we complete multiple sequence comparisons?

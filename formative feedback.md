# This is your formative feedback for the IBI1 portfolio.


## Please do the following:

- [ ] Add this file to your GitHub fork of IBI1_2018-19. You are allowed to delete the last line (giving your score) before uploading the file to GitHub, if you do not want others to see it. 
- [ ] Make changes to your code from weeks 3 to 5 according to the feedback below. This will form part of your summative assessment. (You may use the checkboxes to keep track of your progress) 


## Feedback:

### Feedback Week 3:


- [ ] The website  https://wyixx.github.io/ exists,  but contains no information except the standard template.


### Feedback Week 4:

- [ ] In file variables.py, the variables W and Z are not defined. Define them and check that they are the same, no matter the values of X and Y

- [ ] For the mystery code, be more precise about what it does.

- [ ]  The code for the powers of 2 is almost perfect, but would be even better if there was a space before "is" in the output.


### Feedback Week 5:

- [ ] In the nucleotide counting script: When asking the user for input, include a prompt, such as "Please enter a DNA sequence", so that the user knows what they are supposed to do 

- [ ] Also in the script that reverts words and sorts them, include a user prompt when asking for input.
